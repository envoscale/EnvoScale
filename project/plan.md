# EnvoScale: Working Plan

The working plan: the decisions made along the way (D1, D2, ...), the questions still
open, and the task breakdown for the current milestone. "The brief" below is the
project's original design document; its rules now live in [`principles.md`](principles.md).

- **Current milestones:** M14, the application platform, then M15, the IDE (§6, phase 2: applications). M10 (AArch64 and macOS, §5) continues alongside: AArch64 Linux (D69) and macOS executables (D70) are done; the macOS adapters are next. M0–M9 and M11–M13 are done (records in §4).
- **Live status:** [`status.md`](status.md) is authoritative for what works today.

---

## 1. Understanding

EnvoScale is one language (**EnvoL**), one toolchain (`envo`/`envoc`) and one standard
platform (`envo.*`) that must eventually cover everything from inline assembly to
3-line websites. It has four constraints that shape every decision:

1. **Zero third-party dependencies.** Only what the OS or hardware provides, reached
   through hand-written adapters. Specs and test vectors are data, not dependencies.
2. **Ports and adapters.** `lib/**` is pure and platform-free and defines *ports*;
   `adapters/**` implements them. The dependency arrow points one way and the build
   will enforce it.
3. **A trusted bootstrap.** The compiler starts as auditable assembly (Stage 0), climbs
   through Envo-Core (Stage 1) to full EnvoL (Stage 2), and must reach a byte-identical
   fixed point. A hex seed (Phase B) eventually removes the need for any outside assembler.
4. **Two doors everywhere.** Every API has a short beginner entrance built *on top of*
   a full-control entrance: never a separate code path.

The brief is a decades-long plan. This repository's job right now is to give every
part of that plan a clear home, and to make the first rung of the bootstrap ladder
real and tested. Breadth is done with documents; depth is done with working code.

## 2. Decisions made while reading the brief

These are interpretation choices, not deviations. Each is written down where it lives.

| # | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `.eas` is defined as a **strict subset of NASM syntax** assembled in flat-binary mode. Stage 0 writes its own PE/ELF headers as data, so the Phase A adapter (NASM `-f bin`) and the future seed produce the same bytes from the same file, with no linker. | `EnvoLang/spec/eas.md` |
| D2 | Stage 0 executables use one RWX section/segment at a fixed base (`0x400000`), `TimeDateStamp = 0`, no relocations. Smallest auditable layout; deterministic. | `architecture/bootstrap.md` |
| D3 | Stage 0's internal calling convention is the System V x86-64 register order on both OSes. The Windows shim converts to Win64 at the kernel32 boundary. | `architecture/bootstrap.md` |
| D4 | Envo-Core uses `str` (borrowed UTF-8 view) rather than `string` (owned), so every Core program stays a valid full-Envol program. | `EnvoLang/spec/envo-core.md` |
| D5 | The Stage 0 lexer implements the **full EnvoL lexical grammar** where it is cheap (all keywords and operators are reserved), and rejects only constructs Core excludes (interpolation, raw strings, directives, non-ASCII identifiers) with dedicated `E09xx` errors. | `EnvoLang/spec/01-lexical.md` |
| D6 | Whitespace before `?` is significant , and newlines can end statements. Tokens therefore carry "space before" / "newline before" flags from day one. This is what lets the normative examples (`T?`, `x?`, `a ? b : c`, newline-separated builder blocks) parse without ambiguity. | `EnvoLang/spec/01-lexical.md`, `EnvoLang/spec/03-expressions.md` |
| D7 | `await` covers every async call in its operand , so `await http.Get(url)?.Text()` from §3.3 means what it looks like. There is no `?.` token; `x?.y` is `(x?).y`. | `EnvoLang/spec/03-expressions.md` |
| D8 | Until the `envo` CLI exists (M5), the CI adapter calls `bootstrap.ps1` / `bootstrap.sh`. These are the only build entry points that exist, and they use OS tools only. When `envo` exists, CI switches to `envo` commands. | `adapters/ci/github/README.md` |
| D9 | Diagnostics use stable codes from day one. Ranges: `E0001–E0099` lexical, `E01xx` syntax, `E02xx` names, `E03xx` types, `E05xx` ownership, `E09xx` "not part of Envo-Core". | `EnvoLang/spec/errors.md` |
| D10 | Folder READMEs for subsystems that don't exist yet say so plainly ("Not started: M7") instead of holding stub code. | every `README.md` |
| D11 | Stage 1 is a multi-file Envo-Core program in `bootstrap/stage1/`, built by `envoc0 build` with the file order fixed in `bootstrap/stage1/files.txt` (`main.envol` first). Stage 0's line budget is spent, so Stage 0 gets bug fixes only; anything Stage 1's source would like from the language is done in Core as written. | `bootstrap/stage1/README.md` |
| D12 | The language `envoc1` accepts is **Envo-S1**: Envo-Core plus what the Stage 2 compiler needs to be written comfortably (generics, interfaces, closures, methods, owned strings, `T?`, `Result` and `?`, namespaces, slicing) and nothing more. It is a strict subset of full EnvoL, defined in `EnvoLang/spec/envo-s1.md`, so every S1 program is an EnvoL program. | `EnvoLang/spec/envo-s1.md` |
| D13 | Stage 1 compiles generics by monomorphization and interfaces by static dispatch through generic bounds, plus `dyn` objects with vtables only if the Stage 2 design needs them. Simplest correct choice; Stage 2 may add other strategies. | `EnvoLang/spec/envo-s1.md` |
| D14 | Stage 1 is tested **differentially**: every Envo-Core test runs under both `envoc0` and `envoc1` and must give the same result, and `envoc1 lex` must print the same token dumps as `envoc0 lex`. Two independent implementations of Core catch each other's bugs. | `bootstrap.*`, `tests/` |
| D15 | Stage 1's backend is deliberately simple: EIR → x86-64 with every SSA value in a stack slot, no optimizer, the same one-section executable layout as Stage 0. Speed comes in Stage 2. | `architecture/bootstrap.md` |
| D16 | Stage 2 (`envoc`) is written in **Envo-S1** in `compiler/`, one file per pass in the existing folders, built by `envoc1` from `compiler/files.txt`, until the fixed point (D18); after it, `envoc` may use any EnvoL it compiles. | `compiler/README.md` |
| D17 | Stage 2 keeps EIR v1 (now with its binary form, [eir.bin]) and implements Envo-S1's semantics first, so every Stage 1 test is a Stage 2 test and the two compilers are compared like Stage 0 and Stage 1 were (D14). Full EnvoL grows from there in later milestones. | `architecture/stage2.md` |
| D18 | The **fixed point**: `envoc1` builds `envoc` (stage2a); stage2a builds `envoc` (stage2b); stage2b builds `envoc` (stage2c). stage2b and stage2c must be byte-identical, and identical between the Windows and Linux hosts. CI checks it on every push. | `architecture/stage2.md` |
| D19 | Linking in M3 is **whole-program over EIR objects**: a source file compiles to a binary EIR object (`.eo`); `envoc link` merges objects with the runtime, generates code and writes PE or ELF directly. Foreign objects (COFF/ELF, `.lib`/`.a`) arrive with `extern "C"` in M4. | `architecture/stage2.md` |
| D20 | `-O0` keeps Stage 1's stack-slot code generation (fast and simple); `-O2` adds SSA optimizations (constant folding, copy propagation, dead-code elimination, CFG simplification, inlining of small functions) and linear-scan register allocation. Both are deterministic, and every run test runs at both levels and must agree. | `architecture/stage2.md` |
| D21 | **Library modules** resolve by path until package manifests exist (M5): namespace `a.b` is the file `<lib>/a/b/b.envol` (`std.fs` is `lib/std/fs/fs.envol`), loaded when a file `use`s it, transitively. `envoc --lib <dir>` names the folder that holds `lib/` and `adapters/`. The runtime cannot list folders, and one file per module keeps the rule exact. | `architecture/library.md` |
| D22 | **Ports are interfaces** used through generic bounds (static dispatch, D13): Envo-S1 has no dynamic interface values. An adapter is a struct that implements the port and owns its state. The full-control door takes the port as a parameter (`fs.ReadTextWith(ref myFs, path)`). | `architecture/library.md` |
| D23 | The simple door reaches the target's adapters through one namespace, **`platform`**, which the build binds: `adapters/os/<os>/platform.envol` for the target's OS, or `adapters/os/none` with `--os none`. `lib/` names `platform` but never an adapter namespace (`os.*`); the compiler enforces it (E0213). | `architecture/library.md` |
| D24 | M4's ports are the ones the runtime can serve today: `Console`, `FileSystem`, `Clock`, `Entropy` and `Environment`. `Threads`, `Executor`, `NetStack` and the device ports come with the milestones that need them (M6, M7, M8); `std.thread`, `sync` and `async` wait for them. | `project/plan.md` §5 |
| D25 | Native adapters call the OS directly through the target intrinsics (`__syscall`, `__wincall`). The Windows import table grows in both Stage 1 and Stage 2, so their executables stay byte-identical (D17), and gains a second DLL for the system's random generator. | `architecture/library.md` |
| D26 | **`envo` contains the compiler.** The brief puts every tool in one `envo` binary, so `envo` is built from `compiler/` (minus its entry file) plus `tools/`, and calls the compiler as a library (`envoc.build`). `envoc` stays, as the compiler on its own and the stage the fixed point checks. | `tools/envo/README.md` |
| D27 | **Packages replace the one-file rule** (D21) where a manifest exists: a package is a folder with `envo.envon`; its root module is its `.envol` files outside `tests/`, and a library module is every `.envol` file in its folder. Listing a folder needs `FileSystem.List`, a new port operation. Without a manifest, D21 still applies. | `architecture/tooling.md` |
| D28 | **Running programs** goes through a new port, `Process`: start a program with arguments, wait for it, get its exit code, with its output sent to a file when asked. `envo run`, `envo test` and the language server use it. Windows gets its functions in both stages' import tables (D25). | `architecture/tooling.md` |
| D29 | **The bootstrap scripts stay** for building and testing Stages 0–2: they must work without `envo`. CI calls `envo test` for what `envo` can run (the library, the conformance suites, the examples) in place of the scripts' library block (D8, read for a self-hosting toolchain). | `adapters/ci/github/README.md` |
| D30 | The **language server** is basic in M5: diagnostics only (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics` on open, change and save), computed by running `envo check` on the document as a child process. Hover, completion and go-to-definition need the query-based compiler (brief §8) and come later. | `tools/lsp/README.md` |
| D31 | **The script runtime is an EIR interpreter** in `runtime/vm/`, compiled into `envo`. It runs the module the compiler makes for the host target, with the runtime in it, on host memory: pointers are host addresses, slots and globals are host allocations. Layouts, wrapping, checks and panics are the AOT program's, so the two modes agree by construction. A tiered JIT reusing the backends comes later. | `runtime/vm/README.md` |
| D32 | The VM **forwards the two target intrinsics** (`syscall`, `wincall`) to the host, through a `match` over the import slots for `wincall`. It starts a program by setting its arguments (`__rt_set_args`) and calling `__main`, so the script sees its own arguments, not `envo`'s. A function value is a tagged function index, not a code address. | `runtime/vm/README.md` |
| D33 | **`envo run` runs in the VM**, sandboxed; `envo run --native` builds and runs native code as M5's `run` did; `envo build` is AOT. `envo <file.envol> [args]` is `envo run`, so `#!/usr/bin/env envo` works. | `tools/envo/README.md` |
| D34 | **Permissions** follow the brief's Deno-like model (§2.5): a script has its console and nothing else until `--allow` grants `read[:path]`, `write[:path]`, `fs[:path]` (both), `env`, `run`, `net` (for M7) or `all`. The VM checks them where it forwards system calls; a denied call fails as the OS would with "access denied", so library code sees `IoError.Denied`, and `envo` prints one note per denied capability. | `architecture/script-runtime.md` |
| D35 | **Both modes in the tests**: the bootstrap scripts run every spec run test (`core-run`, `s1-run`, `s2-run`, the multi-file programs) through `envo run --allow all` as well as natively, requiring the same output and exit code; `envo test` runs each library test in the VM too. Error tests share the front end, so they agree by construction. | `tests/README.md` |
| D36 | **`envo repl`** keeps a session of cells: declarations accumulate, and each statement cell runs the session's program again in the VM, showing only the output that is new. A resident VM state needs incremental compilation (the query-based compiler) and comes later. | `tools/envo/README.md` |
| D37 | **`envo.crypto` is written in Envo-S1**, one module per family (`sha2`, `mac`, `chacha`, `aes`, `curve25519`, `random`) under `lib/envo/crypto/`, with `envo.crypto` as the simple door. Constant time by construction: no branch, loop bound or memory index depends on a secret; tags compare in constant time. The whole module stays Experimental until an independent audit (brief §7.2), as its README and `SECURITY.md` say. | `lib/envo/crypto/README.md` |
| D38 | **Test vectors** come from the standards (RFC 8439, 7748, 8032, 4231, 5869; FIPS 180-4 and 197; the GCM specification), copied into the library's tests, with their sources listed in `tests/vectors/README.md`. An algorithm exists only once its vectors pass. | `tests/vectors/README.md` |
| D39 | **The CSPRNG** is ChaCha20 keyed from the `Entropy` port (32 bytes), rekeyed from its own output after each request (fast key erasure), so the system's generator is read once per generator, not per call. | `lib/envo/crypto/README.md` |
| D40 | **A `Net` port** for TCP (connect, listen, accept, read, write, close) and name lookup. Windows: `ws2_32.dll` joins the import table in both stages (D25); Linux: system calls, and a DNS client in EnvoL reading `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`. The script runtime gates it with `--allow net`. | `architecture/network.md` |
| D41 | **TLS 1.3 client** (RFC 8446) with X25519 and `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` / `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`; certificates are verified (X.509 chain to the system's roots, names, validity; RSA and ECDSA P-256 signatures) before any application data. A connection that cannot be verified fails; there is no "insecure" switch in M7. | `architecture/network.md` |
| D42 | **HTTP/1.1** client and server in `envo.http` over the Net port (and TLS for `https`), sharing request and response types. The brief's `serve(8080) { get("/") => … }` door needs trailing blocks, which Envo-S1 lacks; M7 gives the same server as calls (`Router`, `Get`, `Serve`) and the door follows when the language has it. | `lib/envo/http/README.md` |
| D43 | **A Terminal port** (`ITerminal`): write text, the window's size, raw mode on and off, and input as key events. Windows: the console API (a second KERNEL32 import descriptor, D25), with VT input so keys arrive as on Linux; Linux: `ioctl` (`TCGETS`, `TCSETS`, `TIOCGWINSZ`) and VT sequences. `envoui.term` builds a cell buffer with a diffing renderer on it; `envo.cli` (arguments, help, tables, progress) needs only the console. | `EnvoUI/term/README.md` |
| D44 | **`envor.gfx` is a software rasterizer first**: an RGBA canvas with shapes, anti-aliased edges, alpha blending and images, tested by hashing pixels (golden images). The GPU adapters (D46) draw the same commands faster. | `EnvoR/gfx/README.md` |
| D45 | **A Window port** (`IWindow`): open a window, poll events (keys, mouse, resize, close), present an RGBA framebuffer. The Win32 adapter uses `USER32.dll` and `GDI32.dll` from the import table (both stages, added with D43) and `__wincall12`; the window procedure is `DefWindowProcW`, events are read from the message queue, so no callback into EnvoL code is needed; `os.none` gives an off-screen window for tests. Linux windows (X11/Wayland) come after M8, as the brief's DoD names Win32 only. | `architecture/graphics.md` |
| D46 | **`envo.gpu`** is a port (frames of colored triangles, drawn off-screen and read back) with a software adapter in `envo.gpu`, and a Direct3D 12 adapter in `os.windows`. The D3D12 adapter loads the system's libraries at run time through `__wincallp` (a call through a function pointer, in both stages) and compiles its HLSL with the system's `D3DCompile`. Every adapter agrees with the software adapter to within 1 per channel. Vulkan, for Linux GPUs, follows Linux windows after M8, as it needs SPIR-V and the brief's DoD names Win32 windows only. | `architecture/graphics.md` |
| D47 | **`envoui`** is a retained component tree (`Column`, `Row`, `Text`, `Button`, …) with one layout pass, drawn by a desktop renderer (`envor.gfx` into a window) or a terminal renderer (`envoui.term` cells). the theme tokens (`envor/`) are its default theme. | `EnvoUI/ui/README.md` |
| D48 | **A WebAssembly backend in Stage 2** (`--target wasm32-web`): memory keeps the front end's layout (8-byte pointers, addresses below 4 GiB), so EIR is unchanged. Every value is a canonical `i64` local, so the x86-64 backend's checks and panics carry over. Each function is a loop around a `br_table` on its block number; slots live on a shadow stack in memory; function pointers index the module's table. Stage 1 does not need it. | `compiler/backend/wasm/README.md` |
| D49 | **One host import**, `envo.host(k, a, b, c, d)`, reached through a `__hostcall` runtime intrinsic (both stages). The runtime's OS layer (`compiler/runtime/wasm.envol`) and the `os.wasm` adapters call it. `adapters/interop/js/envo.js` implements it in Node.js and browsers, with no framework. Every spec run program and library test runs under Node.js in the bootstrap scripts. | `adapters/interop/js/README.md` |
| D50 | **`envoweb`** on `envo.http`: a router with path parameters, static files with types and confined paths, an HTML builder that escapes by default, and page rendering on the server (SSR) and to files (SSG) from the same code. | `EnvoWeb/web/README.md` |
| D51 | **Markdown** (`envoweb.markdown`: CommonMark's blocks and inlines, with GitHub's tables) and **page templates** for pages (Landing and Docs), with the CSS generated from The theme's tokens. | `EnvoWeb/web/README.md` |
| D52 | **The website is an EnvoL program** (`EnvoWeb/site`, its plan in [website-plan.md](website-plan.md)) that builds the pages and `docs/` into static files with the Landing and Docs templates, served locally by `envoweb`. Publishing it (#61) is the owner's call. The sandbox runs `envoc` itself, built for `wasm32-web`, in the browser. | `website/README.md` |
| D53 | **`envor.math`** for 3D is `f32`, column-major matrices acting on column vectors, a right-handed world (y up, the camera looking down -z), and clip-space depth from 0 (near) to 1 (far), as Direct3D, Vulkan and WebGPU use. | `EnvoR/math/README.md` |
| D54 | **`envor.ecs`**: entities are generational ids; each component type has its own sparse set (`Store<T>`), dense and cache-friendly, with O(1) add, remove and lookup. Envo-S1 has no runtime types, so a program declares its stores; systems are functions over them. Archetype tables and a scheduler come with threads. | `EnvoR/ecs/README.md` |
| D55 | **`envor.render3d` renders in software first**: perspective-correct triangles with a depth buffer, physically based shading (Cook-Torrance: GGX, Smith, Schlick) for directional and point lights, ACES tone mapping and sRGB output, into an `envor.gfx` canvas a window presents. The GPU adapters draw the same frames later. | `EnvoR/render3d/README.md` |
| D56 | **glTF 2.0 import**: `.gltf` with `.bin` buffers or base64 data URIs; meshes (positions, normals, indices), the metallic-roughness material's factors, and the node hierarchy. Textures, skins and animation follow. | `EnvoR/render3d/README.md` |
| D57 | **`envo.ai` tensors are dense row-major `f32`** with CPU kernels in EnvoL, and autograd is a **define-by-run tape** (`Graph`): each forward operation records its inputs, and `Backward` walks the tape in reverse. Training is IEEE arithmetic from a seeded generator, so it gives the same numbers in every build. f16, bf16 and int8 are storage formats, widened to `f32` to compute. | `lib/envo/ai/README.md` |
| D58 | **The tokenizer is byte-level BPE** (GPT-2's byte alphabet): a vocabulary and ranked merges, loaded from a model file or given directly; encoding lowest-rank-first, decoding exact for any bytes. | `lib/envo/ai/README.md` |
| D59 | **Models load from GGUF** (v2 and v3): metadata, the tensor table, and `f32`, `f16` and `Q8_0` tensors, dequantized on load. Every offset and size is checked; a malformed file is refused, never trusted. safetensors and a native `.envomodel` follow. | `lib/envo/ai/README.md` |
| D60 | **Local inference runs the Llama architecture** on the CPU: RMSNorm, rotary positions, grouped-query attention with a KV cache, SwiGLU, greedy or seeded sampling. `ai.Load(path).Ask(prompt)` is the simple door. No model ships with EnvoL: which model to point to is the owner's decision. | `lib/envo/ai/README.md` |
| D61 | **GPU kernels go through `IGpu`**: a compute entry (matrix multiply first) that the software adapter runs in EnvoL and the D3D12 adapter runs as a compute shader. GPU results match the CPU's within a stated tolerance, not bit for bit. | `architecture/graphics.md` |
| D62 | **Embeddings and vector search**: cosine similarity, an exact index, and HNSW for approximate nearest neighbours, deterministic for a given seed. | `lib/envo/ai/README.md` |
| D63 | **`envo prof` counts in the script runtime**: calls and EIR instructions per function, exact and the same on every machine, so profiles compare across changes and can be tested. A sampling profiler for native code follows the debug-information emitters. | `tools/prof/README.md` |
| D64 | **`envo fuzz` is coverage-guided in the VM**: the target reads the file named by its first argument; every input runs in one VM (exits and panics end the run, globals are reset, the input is served from memory) that notes the EIR blocks run; new coverage joins the corpus; mutations include a dictionary of the constants the target's own code compares with. Seeded and deterministic per host. | `tools/fuzz/README.md` |
| D65 | **`envo dbg` debugs in the VM at source level**: every EIR instruction carries its statement's file and line (`EInst.Src`) and modules list named locals (`Module.Locals`); breakpoints, step, next, finish, backtrace and locals; commands on stdin so sessions are scripted. Native debugging (DWARF, CodeView) and the Debug Adapter Protocol follow. | `tools/dbg/README.md` |
| D66 | **Packages have dependencies** by path or from a registry, compiled with the package's sources. `envo.lock.envon` records each registry archive's SHA-256; a canonical archive format (`.envopkg`) makes packing reproducible; Ed25519 signatures are checked against `trust` keys. Registries are an `IRegistry` port with a folder adapter; a network registry is the owner's decision. | `tools/pkg/README.md` |
| D67 | **The hex seed is asm0**, an assembler for the Stage 0 subset written in that subset on Stage 0's own runtime block, recorded as commented hex (`seed-linux.hex`, `seed-windows.hex`) that `hex2bin.sh`/`hex2bin.ps1` turn into the program with OS tools alone. It assembles Stage 0 to NASM's exact bytes; the build uses it when NASM is missing. | `bootstrap/seed/README.md` |
| D68 | **Stage 1 and Stage 2 executables are W^X and ASLR-enabled** (issue #80): code and data on separate pages with their own protections; Linux programs are `ET_DYN` and relocate their 8-byte absolute addresses with a stub at the entry (no dynamic loader needed); Windows programs carry `.reloc` and `DYNAMIC_BASE`/`HIGH_ENTROPY_VA`. Both stages write identical bytes, so the D17 comparisons hold. Stage 0's own executables keep D2's layout. | `architecture/stage1.md` |
| D69 | **AArch64 Linux, tested on an arm64 machine in CI** (M10): `--target aarch64-linux`; a backend that follows the x86-64 one at -O0 instruction for instruction (values in frame slots, arguments on the stack, the same checks and NaN rules), ELF `ET_DYN` with 64 KiB pages and the D68 self-relocation stub; the runtime's OS layer is `compiler/runtime/linux_aarch64.envol`. A library module may have a file per architecture, `<name>.<arch>.envol`, taken before `<name>.envol` (the Linux adapter's `os.linux.sys`). Programs are cross-built on x86-64 (`bootstrap.sh cross`) and run on GitHub's arm64 runner (`cross-run`), free since the repository is public. | `compiler/backend/aarch64/README.md` |
| D70 | **macOS on arm64 by raw system calls, for now** (M10): `--target aarch64-macos` writes a position-independent Mach-O `MH_EXECUTE` that dyld starts (`LC_MAIN`, linked to libSystem but importing nothing), with W^X segments and an ad-hoc code signature (SHA-256 per 4 KiB page, as the linker signs), since macOS runs no unsigned arm64 code. The runtime calls the kernel directly (`svc #0x80`). Apple does not promise that interface across releases; calling libSystem through imports is the planned replacement, before the macOS adapters grow. Run in CI on GitHub's macOS runner. | `compiler/backend/aarch64/README.md` |
| D71 | **Applications live in their own repositories** (phase 2): each app (the IDE first) is a separate repository built with the toolchain (a pinned EnvoScale commit in its CI until releases exist) and the standard platform it ships. An app holds only its own code: anything it needs from an operating system, a GPU or a host is a port in `lib/ports` with adapters in this repository's `adapters/`, never in the app. What several apps need goes into the standard platform. | §6 |
| D72 | **One UI, many hosts**: apps draw with `envoui` into a canvas (`envor.gfx`). A desktop window (the Window port's adapters), a browser page (the wasm adapter over a canvas) and a terminal (cells) are hosts for the same code, so web and desktop versions of an app come from one program. | §6 |
| D73 | **Ports speak EnvoScale's terms**: key codes and modifier keys are defined by `ports`, not by an operating system; adapters translate Win32 virtual keys, X11 keysyms and DOM key names to them. The same goes for every new port (clipboard, processes with pipes). | §6 |
| D74 | **The editor core is UI-free**: `envoui.edit` holds text buffers, cursors and selections, undo and search, tested without a window; `envoui`'s code editor draws and drives it. | §6 |
| D75 | **Language intelligence through the language server**: `envo query` indexes a checked program (declarations, references, types and doc comments); `envo lsp` answers completion, hover, go-to-definition and symbols from the last good index of each package. Editors, the IDE included, use it over LSP. | §6 |
| D76 | **The runtime's heap frees**: `__rt_alloc` takes blocks from per-size free lists (powers of two, 16 bytes to 1 MiB, each with a 16-byte header) and `__rt_free` returns them; memory stays zeroed when handed out, as before. Long-running programs (an IDE, a server) stop growing. Frees of pointers the heap did not hand out, or twice, are ignored. A block over 1 MiB gets its own mapping with four times its room reserved after it (none on WebAssembly, where memory grown is memory taken), and `realloc` grows it there: a `List` or `string` that keeps growing is not copied each time it doubles (2026-11-13). | §6 |
| D77 | **The browser host yields through JSPI**: a windowed program keeps its blocking `while (w.IsOpen())` loop on every host. In a page, `envo.js` wraps its one import in `WebAssembly.Suspending` and starts the program through `WebAssembly.promising`, so a `Poll` that finds no event waits for the next animation frame and the page stays responsive. The compiler and the program are unchanged (no second import, no Asyncify). Where a browser lacks JSPI, `EnvoWeb.canYield()` is false and a page says so instead of freezing. | `adapters/interop/js/README.md` |
| D78 | **The bootstrap lives in its own repository** (2026-11-13): the seed, stage 0 and stage 1 moved to [EnvoScaleAsm](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoScaleAsm). EnvoScale builds from a seed compiler that EnvoScaleAsm builds from assembly: `build.sh` downloads it from a `seed-*` release, or builds it from EnvoScaleAsm at a pinned commit when no release is available, and checks its SHA-256 either way; the seed builds the compiler, which builds itself again, and `test` checks the fixed point. EnvoScaleAsm checks the other direction (the compiler built by stage 1 behaves as the one built by itself) at the EnvoScale commit it pins. The compiler stays in Envo-S1 while stage 1 must build it; moving it to full EnvoL means bumping the seed and leaving stage 1 behind on purpose. The runtime sources the compiler embeds moved to `compiler/runtime/`, and `envoc embed` makes `driver/runtime*.envol`. | §6 |
| D79 | **Speed is measured against Rust** (M16): EnvoLangRust ports the compiler function for function, with the same output, and the two are timed on the same inputs. The work goes where the profile says: first the code envoc generates (locals promoted to values by `opt/mem2reg.envol`; the x86-64 backend computing in registers, fusing compare and branch, and using ten registers instead of five), then inlining, loops and the allocator. The benchmark and its history are in EnvoLangRust's README. | §7 |

## 3. Open questions

Items marked **RFC** conflict with the brief as written and are tracked in an RFC
(§0.7). The others are choices the project owner should confirm.

1. ~~**RFC 0001**~~ **Accepted 2026-11-11** (C1 `Copy` bound, C2 `Trimmed()`). Original question: **RFC 0001: normative example audit.** Some §3.3 examples can't type-check under
   the brief's own rules: `Largest<T>` moves a non-`Copy` `T` out of a borrowed span
   ("no hidden copies"), and `ReadConfig` returns `text.Trim()`, a borrow of a local,
   as an owned `string`. See [`rfcs/0001-normative-example-audit.md`](../rfcs/0001-normative-example-audit.md).
2. ~~**License.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-13 by the owner:** Apache-2.0 for every repository
   with code, CC BY 4.0 for the documentation, contributions under the CLA. (Until then
   the project was under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 with commercial licenses.) See
   [licensing](../legal/licensing.md).
3. ~~**Explicit lifetime syntax.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-11 by [RFC 0004](../rfcs/0004-lifetimes-and-views.md):**
   borrow origins (`from a, b`), inferred for functions a library does not export, and `mut T[]` for
   writable views. Original question: the brief says explicit lifetimes "exist but are
   rarely needed" without giving a spelling. A `'a` spelling collides with character
   literals. Deferred to an RFC ([#31](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/31));
   the draft spec reports elision failures as an error with no explicit escape hatch yet.
4. ~~**Function types.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-11 by [RFC 0003](../rfcs/0003-function-types.md):**
   `fn(A) -> R`, with closure kinds `fn` / `mut fn` / `once fn`, generic in parameter
   position and a code + environment value elsewhere; `extern "C" fn` for C. Original
   question: no syntax is given for function pointer / closure types.
5. ~~**Unicode paths on Windows.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-11: UTF-8 everywhere.** Stage 0 now uses the `…W` APIs and converts with kernel32's UTF-8 routines. Original question: Stage 0 uses the `…A` kernel32 entry points, so paths
   must be in the active code page. Fixing it means UTF-16 conversion in assembly;
   deferred unless it blocks someone (tracked in `STATUS.md`).
6. **Edition name.** The brief uses `edition = "2027"` while the current year is 2026.
   Kept as written; the first stable edition will be named when it ships.
7. ~~**Slices in Envo-Core.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-11 by [RFC 0002](../rfcs/0002-slicing.md):**
   `a[lo..hi]` in full EnvoL and Envo-S1; Core keeps no slicing (Stage 0's budget), so
   Stage 1's source uses a pointer and a length.
8. ~~**How Stage 1 programs get their runtime.**~~ **Decided 2026-11-11 (M2.7):** the
   Stage 1 runtime is written in Envo-Core and compiled into every program `envoc1`
   builds, on top of two target intrinsics the backend encodes (`syscall` on Linux,
   `wincall` for `KERNEL32.dll` imports on Windows). See
   [`architecture/stage1.md`](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoScaleAsm/blob/main/docs/stage1.md). Original question: Stage 0 copies
   its own assembled runtime block into each output program; `envoc1` cannot do that.

  one host import and `envo.js` (D49), `envoweb` with SSR and SSG as one code path
  (D50), `envoweb.markdown` and EnvoWeb's templates (D51), and the website as an EnvoL program
  with an in-browser sandbox, the compiler itself in WebAssembly (D52). Increments
  9.1–9.8.

- **M11: 3D.** Floats in Envo-S1 (RFC 0006) first; `envor.math` (D53), `envor.ecs`
  (D54), a software PBR renderer whose frames are identical in every build (D55), glTF
  2.0 import (D56), and the `scene` simple door. Increments 11.1–11.6.

  commented hex and the OS alone (D67). Increments 13.1–13.6.

## 5. M10: AArch64 and macOS

**DoD (brief §16):** AArch64 backend, Mach-O linker, macOS OS/window/Metal adapters.

M10 was blocked on machines to test on. The repository is public now, so GitHub's arm64
Linux and macOS runners are free, and CI tests on them:

| # | Increment | Tested by | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | The AArch64 backend and ELF executables, `--target aarch64-linux` (D69) | the run tests at -O0 and -O2 on CI's arm64 runner | done |
| 10.2 | The Linux adapter for AArch64 (`os.linux.sys` per architecture) | the library's tests on the arm64 runner | done |
| 10.3 | Mach-O executables and the macOS OS layer (`--target aarch64-macos`, D70) | the run tests and the reference-adapter library tests on CI's macOS runner | done |
| 10.4 | libSystem imports in place of raw system calls, then the macOS adapters: files, processes, network, terminal | the library's tests on the macOS runner | next |
| 10.5 | The macOS window and Metal adapters | the gallery's window programs on the macOS runner | |
| 10.6 | Registers at -O2 for AArch64 (x19-x28, D20's linear scan) | the run and library tests at -O2 on both runners | done |

Before the runners were free, work moved to what M11 and M12 needed first:

## 6. Phase 2: applications (M14, M15)

The direction after M13: replace commercial software bit by bit with EnvoScale
applications, each in its own repository (D71), adding to the platform whatever they
need. The IDE comes first: it needs only text, UI and language intelligence, it is used
every day, and it pushes the UI toolkit hardest in the right places. Then, as the
platform grows: a disassembler and debugger, an image editor, a game engine and a 3D
studio (they need GPU rendering on every OS and faster code), and a music studio (it
needs audio on every OS and real-time behaviour). Apps take inspiration, not trade dress:
names, logos and look-and-feel of other products are not copied (legal review, #35).

**M14: the application platform** (this repository):

| # | Increment | Tested by | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| [14.1](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/149) | A heap that frees (D76) | every suite and the fixed point, with memory reused | Done |
| [14.2](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/150) | Input in EnvoScale's terms: key codes, modifiers, a clipboard port (D73) | the reference adapters; the Windows adapter | Done |
| [14.3](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/151) | Processes with pipes: spawn, write, read without blocking, wait, kill | conformance tests on Windows and Linux | Done |
| [14.4](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/152) | Language intelligence: `envo query`; completion, hover, definition and symbols in `envo lsp` (D75) | `tests/lsp` sessions | Done |
| [14.5](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/153) | `envoui.edit`: buffers, cursors, selections, undo, search (D74) | `EnvoUI/edit/tests` | Done |
| [14.6](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/154) | `envoui` for applications: scrolling, lists and trees, tabs, split panes, the code editor, a command palette | pixel and cell tests | Done |
| [14.7](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/155) | Linux windows: X11 over its socket, in `adapters/os/linux` | CI under Xvfb | Done |
| [14.7b](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/167) | The Linux clipboard: the X11 `CLIPBOARD` selection | the clipboard test under Xvfb | Done |
| [14.8](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/156) | The browser host: `envoui` programs in a page (D72) | the wasm tests; a page in the site | Done |
| [14.8b](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/168) | A font for pages, then an editor demo on the site (owner decision: which font ships) | a page in the site | Needs Decision |
| [14.9](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/157) | A VS Code extension (`adapters/editors/vscode`): grammar, editor settings, an LSP client with no npm dependencies | the extension's own tests in CI | Done |
| [14.10](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/158) | Docs and status; M14 complete | CI | Done |

**M15: EnvIDE, the IDE** (its own repository, D71):

| # | Increment | Tested by | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| [15.1](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/159) | The repository: CI against a pinned toolchain; the app shell in a window | CI on Windows and Linux | |
| [15.2](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/160) | Files: an explorer, tabs, open and save, the code editor | UI tests | |
| [15.3](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/161) | Language: diagnostics, completion, hover, definition through `envo lsp` | scripted sessions | |
| [15.4](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/162) | Build, run and test with an output panel; a terminal panel | scripted sessions | |
| [15.5](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/163) | Debugging through `envo dbg` | a scripted session | |
| [15.6](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/164) | The web version, through the browser host | the wasm build | |

macOS windows wait on M10's libSystem imports ([10.4](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/165), [10.5](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/166)).

## 7. Risks

- **Envo-S1 is a small language for a library.** No floats, no dynamic interface
  values, no classes; lambdas own no resources. Mitigation: M4's layers use what S1 has
  (static dispatch, D22), and each module's README says what changes when `envoc`
  accepts more of EnvoL. APIs are designed for full EnvoL and implemented in S1 now.
- **The heap never freed** (Stage 1's runtime) until D76. Freeing memory can expose
  code that used memory after giving it back; the suites, the fuzzers and the fixed point
  are the guard.
- **OS behaviour differs.** Conformance suites define the behaviour each port promises,
  and run against every adapter on both hosts in CI. A difference is an adapter bug or a
  suite that promised too much.
- **Untestable Linux path locally.** Development happens on Windows; Linux binaries
  only run in CI. Unchanged from M1.
- **Spec drift.** Chapters 1–5 are drafts; the library is written against Envo-S1,
  which is normative where `envoc` implements it.
