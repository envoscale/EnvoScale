# EnvoScale Status

Where every subsystem stands. Any change that moves a subsystem forward or back updates
this file. Tiers: **Experimental** may change or vanish,
**Preview** needs an RFC for breaking changes, **Stable** follows SemVer and editions.
", " means the subsystem doesn't exist yet.

_Last updated: 2026-11-13._ The bootstrap from assembly (stages 0 and 1, M1 and M2 below)
now lives in [EnvoScaleAsm](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoScaleAsm) (PLAN D78); paths
below that start with `bootstrap/` are there. Work is tracked on the
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/envoscale/projects/3): one epic per milestone, increments
as sub-issues, owner decisions marked **Needs Decision**.

## Milestones

| # | Milestone | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Charter and skeleton | **Done** |
| M1 | Stage 0 | **Done** |
| M2 | Stage 1 | **Done**: `envoc1`, written in Envo-Core, compiles Envo-Core and Envo-S1 |
| M3 | Self-hosting | **Done**: `envoc`, written in Envo-S1, compiles itself at `-O2` to a fixed point, checked in CI on both hosts; objects and linking; ownership beyond Stage 1 (3.1–3.10, `docs/PLAN.md` §5) |
| M4 | Foundations | **Done**: `core`, `alloc`, `ports`, `std` in Envo-S1 through `envoc --lib`; reference, Windows and Linux adapters; conformance suites passing on both hosts (4.1–4.7) |
| M5 | Daily tooling | **Done**: the `envo` binary (the compiler as a library) with `new`, `build`, `run`, `check`, `test`, `fmt`, `lsp`, `explain`; packages; rich diagnostics; `FileSystem.List` and the `Process` port; `envo.eon`, `envo.json` (5.1–5.8) |
| M6 | Script runtime | **Done**: `envo run` interprets the program's EIR, sandboxed with `--allow` permissions; scripts and `#!/usr/bin/env envo`; `envo repl`; every spec run test and library test passes in both modes (6.1–6.7) |
| M7 | Crypto and network | **Done** (Experimental, not audited): `envo.crypto` (SHA-2, HMAC/HKDF, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-GCM, X25519, Ed25519, a CSPRNG; RSA, ECDSA and X.509 verification), the Net and Trust ports, `envo.http` (HTTP/1.1 client and server), `envo.tls` (a verifying TLS 1.3 client) (7.1–7.8) |
| M8 | Graphics and UI | **Done** (Experimental): `envo.term` and the Terminal port, `envo.cli`, `envo.gfx`, `envo.font`, the Window port (Win32), `envo.lumen` and `envo.ui` (desktop and terminal renderers), `envo.gpu` (software and Direct3D 12) (8.1–8.9) |
| M9 | Web | **Done** (Experimental): the WebAssembly backend, the JS host and `os.wasm`, `envo.markdown`, `envo.web` with Lumen's Landing and Docs templates, the website and its in-browser sandbox, built by EnvoL programs (9.1–9.8) |
| M10 | AArch64 and macOS | **In progress**: AArch64 Linux works (Experimental, D69): `--target aarch64-linux`, the run tests and the library's tests pass on CI's arm64 runner. macOS executables work (Experimental, D70): `--target aarch64-macos`, signed Mach-O, the run tests pass on CI's macOS runner. Next: the macOS adapters, then the window and Metal |
| M11 | 3D | **Done** (Experimental; ahead of M10): floats (RFC 0006), `envo.math`, `envo.ecs`, `envo.render3d` (software PBR: the same frame bit for bit in every build), glTF 2.0 import, the 3D gallery program in a window (11.1–11.6) |
| M12 | AI | **Done** (Experimental): `envo.ai` tensors, autograd and optimizers; BPE, SentencePiece and WordPiece tokenizers; GGUF loading (11 tensor types); local inference for the Llama family; a text encoder (nomic-bert), exact and HNSW vector search; a matrix product on the GPU through `IGpu` (12.1–12.7) |
| M13 | Ecosystem | **Done** (Experimental): `envo prof`, `envo fuzz` (coverage-guided), `envo dbg` (source-level), package dependencies with a lock, signed archives and a registry adapter, and the hex seed: Stage 0 built from commented hex with the OS alone, byte-identical to NASM (13.1–13.6) |
| M14 | The application platform | **Done** (Experimental): a heap that frees, key codes and a clipboard port, processes with pipes, `envo query` and completion, hover, definition, symbols and formatting in `envo lsp`, `envo.edit`, application components in `envo.ui`, Linux windows over X11, the browser host, a VS Code extension (14.1–14.10). Open: a font for pages (#168, owner) |
| M15 | EnvIDE, the IDE | **In progress** (PLAN §6): the shell (15.1) in its own repository, EnvIDE; files and the editor are next |
| M16 | Performance | **In progress** (PLAN D79): against the compiler ported to Rust (EnvoScaleRust). Locals promoted to SSA values, and the x86-64 backend computing in registers with ten of them: with division by constants and jump tables too, the lex and parse benchmark is 38% and 30% faster; Rust is still about 4.5x faster on Windows |

## Known limitations

- **Linux runs only in CI.** WSL is broken on the dev machine, so Linux binaries are built
  locally but run by the `stage0-linux` job.
- **Source files are limited to 16 MiB** in Stages 0 and 1.
- **Envo-Core can't make a non-empty slice.** Slicing ([RFC 0002](../rfcs/0002-slicing.md))
  is Envo-S1 and up, so Core code, including Stage 1, uses a pointer and a length.
- **The legal documents haven't been reviewed by a lawyer.** `LICENSE` uses the PolyForm
  Noncommercial License 1.0.0. The commercial templates in `docs/legal/`, `CLA.md` and
  `TRADEMARKS.md` are drafts, and the licensor is still a GitHub handle. Both need fixing
  before the first commercial license is sold
  ([#35](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/35)).
