# The standard platform: layers, ports and adapters (M4)

`lib/` is the standard platform, written in Envo-S1 and compiled by `envoc` (Stage 2).
It reaches the outside world only through ports (`lib/ports`), which adapters
(`adapters/os/*`) implement. [`ports-and-adapters.md`](ports-and-adapters.md) gives the
general shape; this page records how M4 builds it. Decisions D21–D25 are in
[`PLAN.md`](../project/plan.md).

## Layers

| Module | Namespace | What it has | Ports |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/core/text` | `core.text` | search, trim, split once, ASCII classes | none |
| `lib/core/fmt` | `core.fmt` | integers to text and back, into a caller's buffer | none |
| `lib/core/math` | `core.math` | integer helpers | none |
| `lib/core/hash` | `core.hash` | FNV-1a, SplitMix mixing, the `IKey` interface for hash tables | none |
| `lib/alloc/map`, `set`, `box` | `alloc.map`, … | `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, `Box<T>` | none |
| `lib/alloc/text` | `alloc.text` | text helpers that build a `string` or a `List<str>` | none |
| `lib/ports` | `ports` | `IConsole`, `IFileSystem`, `IClock`, `IEntropy`, `IEnvironment`, `IProcess`, `IoError` | defines them |
| `lib/std/io`, `fs`, `path`, `time`, `env`, `random`, `process` | `std.io`, … | the OS-level services | Console, FileSystem, Clock, Entropy, Environment, Process |

`core` allocates nothing. `alloc` adds the heap. The S1 prelude (`List`, `string`,
`Option`, `Result`) is still the one Stage 1 embeds; it moves into `lib/prelude` once
`envoc` compiles its own prelude.

## Finding a module (D21)

`envoc --lib <dir>` names the folder that holds `lib/` and `adapters/`. When a file says
`use a.b` and no loaded file declares namespace `a.b`, `envoc` loads
`<dir>/lib/a/b/b.envol`, then does the same for the files it loaded, until nothing new is
used. The rule maps a namespace to exactly one file, because the runtime cannot list a
folder yet. Package manifests (`envo.envon`, M5) will let a module span files.

`use a.b;` makes `b` a name for the namespace, in types too (`b.Map<K, V>`).

A used namespace that no file declares and that has no module file is **E0214**.

## Adapters and the platform binding (D22, D23)

A port is an interface, used through generic bounds: Envo-S1 has no dynamic interface
values (D13, D22). Each adapter is a struct that implements the port:

| Namespace | Folder | Adapters |
|---|---|---|
| `os.none` | `adapters/os/none` | reference: captured `Console`, pass-through `Stdio`, in-memory `FileSystem`, manual `Clock`, seeded `Entropy`, fixed `Environment`, scripted `Process` (echoing programs known by name), a sized in-memory `Terminal`, an off-screen `Window` |
| `os.windows` | `adapters/os/windows` | KERNEL32 and ADVAPI32 through `__wincall` |
| `os.linux` | `adapters/os/linux` | system calls through `__syscall` |

`os.<name>` loads `adapters/os/<name>/<name>.envol`. The namespace **`platform`** is the
one place where `lib/` meets an adapter. It loads `adapters/os/<os>/platform.envol`, where
`<os>` is the target's operating system or `none` with `--os none`. Every binding
provides the same constructors: `platform.Console()`, `FileSystem()`, `Clock()`,
`Entropy()`, `Environment()`, `Process()`, `Net()`, `Trust()`, `Terminal()`, `Window()`. Code that uses them writes `var fs = platform.FileSystem();`
and works with any binding.

Each `std` module has two doors. The simple door (`fs.ReadText(path)`) uses the platform
binding. The full-control door (`fs.CreateDirAllWith(ref myFs, path)`) takes any adapter,
such as an in-memory file system in a test.

A file under `lib/` may use `platform` but no `os.*` namespace (**E0215**). The library
names the binding, never an adapter, so it stays platform-free.

With `--os none` a program is deterministic and touches nothing outside itself:
- files are in memory;
- the clock stands at 2026-01-01 00:00 UTC;
- entropy is seeded with 0;
- the only argument is `program`.

Its console is still the process's own, so its output can be read.

## Native adapters (D25)

The native adapters call the OS directly through the target intrinsics:
- `__syscall(n, …)` on Linux;
- `__wincall(k, …)` on Windows, where `k` is a slot in the executable's import address
  table.

M4 grew the Windows import table, identically in Stage 1 and Stage 2, so their
executables stay byte-identical:
- KERNEL32 slots 0–18 (12–18 are new: the precise system time, the performance counter,
  `DeleteFileW`, `CreateDirectoryW`, `RemoveDirectoryW`, `GetFileAttributesW`);
- M5 (D28) added slots 19–27: `CreateProcessW`, `WaitForSingleObject`,
  `GetExitCodeProcess`, `FindFirstFileW`, `FindNextFileW`, `FindClose`,
  `SetHandleInformation`, `GetEnvironmentVariableW`, `GetCurrentDirectoryW`;
- slot 28 ends KERNEL32's;
- slot 29 is ADVAPI32's `SystemFunction036` (RtlGenRandom), the system's random
  generator, and slot 30 ends it;
- M7 (D40) added WS2_32's Winsock functions at slots 31–45, ended by slot 46, and
  (D41) CRYPT32's certificate store functions at slots 47–49, ended by slot 50
  ([`network.md`](network.md));
- M8 (D43, D45) added a second KERNEL32 descriptor at slots 51–60, ended by 61:
  `GetConsoleMode`, `SetConsoleMode`, `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo`, `SetConsoleOutputCP`,
  `ReadConsoleInputW`, `GetModuleHandleW`, `GetProcAddress`, `LoadLibraryW`,
  `PeekNamedPipe`, `Sleep`; USER32's window functions at slots 62–76, ended by 77; and
  GDI32's `SetDIBitsToDevice` at slot 78, ended by 79. A DLL may have more than one
  descriptor, so the earlier slots keep their numbers.

`__wincall` takes the slot and 10 arguments (`CreateProcessW` has 10); `__wincall12`
takes the slot and 12 (`CreateWindowExW`, `SetDIBitsToDevice`) and is the same `wincall`
intrinsic in EIR. `__wincallp(fn, …)` calls a function found at run time (by
`GetProcAddress`, or a COM method from an object's table) the same way, with 12
arguments; `os.windows.ProcAddress(dll, name)` and `CallPointer` wrap it. The GPU
adapter reaches Direct3D 12 this way. The script runtime's sandbox lets the console calls through and refuses
the loader, USER32 and GDI32 calls unless the program is allowed `all`
([`script-runtime.md`](script-runtime.md)).

Paths reach Windows as UTF-16 and Linux as NUL-terminated copies. Both refuse a path that
holds a NUL byte.

## Conformance (M4.4, M4.5)

`tests/conformance/<port>/` holds one program per port. Each gets its adapter from
`platform` and checks what the port promises: for example, `Write` without its directory
is `NotFound`, and the monotonic clock never goes back. It prints only failures and a
final line. The test scripts run every suite against the reference adapters
(`--os none`) and against the native ones, at `-O0` and `-O2`, on both hosts in CI. An
adapter is complete when its suites pass.

## Tests

- `lib/*/tests/`, `adapters/os/*/tests/`: programs with `// expect:` lines, built by
  `envoc --lib` at `-O0` and `-O2`; `// os: none` selects the reference adapters.
- `tests/conformance/`: as above.
- `tests/spec/lib/`: library resolution errors (E0214, E0215).

## What waits for later

- `std.thread`, `sync`, `async` and the `Threads`, `Executor` and `NetStack` ports: the
  runtime is single-threaded (D24; M6–M7).
- Directory listing: no port operation yet. It needs `getdents64` and `FindFirstFileW`;
  planned with the build system (M5), which needs it.
- Floats (`core.math`), a `write` that reports errors, an allocator interface for
  collections: with the EnvoL features `envoc` does not compile yet.
