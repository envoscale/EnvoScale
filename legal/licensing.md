# Licensing

EnvoScale is **free for individuals and noncommercial use**. **Companies need a
commercial license.** The legal terms are in [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/blob/main/LICENSE); this page explains
them in plain words. If this page and `LICENSE` ever disagree, `LICENSE` wins.

> EnvoScale is *source-available*, not *open source* in the OSI sense: anyone can read,
> build, change and learn from the code, but commercial use is licensed separately.

In machine-readable form (SPDX), EnvoScale's license is
`PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0 OR LicenseRef-EnvoScale-Commercial`.

## Which license do I need?

| You are… | You may use EnvoScale under | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| An individual learning, experimenting, or building personal or hobby projects | Community License (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0) | Free |
| A student, teacher, school, university or public research institution | Community License | Free |
| A charity, public-health, public-safety or environmental organization, or a government institution | Community License | Free |
| A company, of any size, using EnvoScale for its work, product or services | **Commercial License** | Paid |
| An individual using EnvoScale to earn money (freelance work, a paid product, a commercial service) | **Commercial License** | Paid |
| A company that wants to try EnvoScale before buying | **Evaluation license** (30 days, internal only) | Free, on request |

When in doubt, you need a commercial license, or you can ask (see below).

## What each license covers

### Community License

- Use, build, modify and share EnvoScale for noncommercial purposes.
- Programs you build for those purposes are yours, and you can share them for
  noncommercial use.
- No warranty and no support guarantees. Community help is best-effort through the
  repository's issues.

### Commercial License

A commercial license is a signed **Order Form** that incorporates the standard
**EnvoScale Commercial License Agreement**. Both templates are public, so you can read the
terms before asking: [agreement](commercial-license-agreement.md),
[order form](order-form.md). It covers:

- Use of EnvoScale by your organization for any purpose, including in products and
  services you sell, and internal tools.
- Distribution of programs built with EnvoScale. Compiled programs contain parts of the
  EnvoScale runtime and standard platform, so shipping them commercially is part of
  what the commercial license grants.
- Planned enterprise terms (see [Enterprise](#enterprise)): support with response times,
  long-term-support releases, security advisories ahead of public disclosure, and
  indemnification, as agreed in the license agreement.

## Programs you build with EnvoScale

Your own source code belongs to you under either license. The compiled output also
contains EnvoScale's runtime and standard platform code, which is licensed to you on the
same terms as the toolchain you built it with:

- built under the Community License → usable and shareable for noncommercial purposes;
- built under a Commercial License → usable and distributable commercially, as your
  agreement says.

## Sharing programs under the Community License

The Community License requires that anyone who gets a copy of any part of EnvoScale from
you also gets the license terms (or their URL) and the `Required Notice:` line. Compiled
programs contain the runtime, so when you share one, include this text with it, for
example in its README or "about" screen:

```
Contains EnvoScale, licensed under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0
(https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0).
Required Notice: Copyright (c) 2026 Glatrix (https://github.com/envoscale)
```

## Name and logo

The licenses cover the software, not the EnvoScale name and logos. See
[`TRADEMARKS.md`](TRADEMARKS.md).

## Enterprise

EnvoScale is being built to be enterprise-ready by the end of its roadmap: reproducible
and signed releases, a software bill of materials for every build, long-term-support
releases, a published security response process, offline installation, and a private
package registry option. Progress is tracked under the **Enterprise readiness** milestone
on the [roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/envoscale/projects/3).

## Getting a commercial license

Contact the licensor through the [envoscale organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/envoscale). Standard editions and prices are being set
([#36](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/36)); until then, Order Forms are
quoted per customer. No commercial agreement is signed before the templates' legal review
([#35](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/issues/35)) is complete.

## Why PolyForm Noncommercial

The Community License is a standard license, not one written for EnvoScale: the
[PolyForm Project](https://polyformproject.org) publishes it, lawyers drafted it, and it
has an official SPDX identifier, so the license scanners companies use recognize it. Its
full text is in [`LICENSES/`](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/blob/main/LICENSES/PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0.md). The other
common source-available licenses were rejected because they do not keep companies out
without a license:

- **Business Source License 1.1** must turn into an open-source license within four years
  of each release, after which companies could use that release for free.
- **Functional Source License** does the same after two years.
- **Elastic License 2.0** and the **Server Side Public License** allow most commercial use
  and restrict only hosted services.
- **PolyForm Small Business** lets companies under a size limit use it for free.

## Contributing

Contributions are accepted under the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md), which
lets the project offer contributed work under both licenses.

## Why this model

The Community License keeps EnvoScale free for the people the project is built for at
skill levels 0–4: beginners, students, researchers and hobbyists. Commercial licenses
fund full-time work on the compiler, the standard platform, security audits (for
example of `envo.crypto`, see [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/envoscale/EnvoLang/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md)) and long-term support.
