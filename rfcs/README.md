# RFCs

An RFC is required for any change to the language, EIR, a stable API, a port interface,
or the charter (brief §15). It is also how the project resolves places where the
founding brief is ambiguous or contradicts itself (brief §0.7).

## Process

1. Copy [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md) to `NNNN-short-title.md` using the next
   free number.
2. Open a pull request containing only the RFC. Discussion happens there.
3. The RFC is **accepted** or **rejected** after review; the status line records which
   and when. Accepted RFCs are implemented in later pull requests that link back to it.
4. Implemented RFCs record the commit or milestone that completed them.
